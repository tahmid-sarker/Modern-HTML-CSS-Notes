## Overview

1. **VH (Viewport Height)** → `1vh = 1%` of the viewport height.
2. **VW (Viewport Width)** → `1vw = 1%` of the viewport width.
3. **Responsive layout** → Elements scale with the viewport size.
4. **Font sizing** → Use `vw` to make text size adjust with screen width.
5. **Full-screen sections** → `height: 100vh` covers the full viewport height.
